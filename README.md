# Catan Data Tracker
 A C#/XAML WPF application that can track most all of the relevant data points for an individual game of Settlers of Catan.
 This application supports data tracking for the original Settlers of Catan tabletop board game as well as the expansion Seafarers. The application supports the tracking of up to 6 players.

## IMPORTANT NOTES
 1) In this repository, I have included only the resources for the application as well as all of the code that I personally created. I did not include the C# solution file, nor any auto-generated files that come with the creation of a new C# WPF project in Visual Studio 2022.
 2) This code is rough. This was the first major project that I created on my own very shortly after learning the absolute basics of coding. If I were to code this again, it would certainly look very different.
